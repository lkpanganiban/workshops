# Getting Started with Geospatial Applications

The following repository is a workshop conducted in Pista ng Mapa 2023 in Tacloban. This goes through with various setup on how you can develop geospatial applications using web technologies.

## Requirements

- Git
- Docker
- docker-compose
- text editor (VSCode)
- QGIS (if you want to preview the data)

## Setups and Configurations

1. PostGIS + Django
2. Opensearch + Leaflet
3. Geoserver

## How to Use

- Go into each directory and run `docker compose up`. This will spin up all the necessary services and containers to start the system.
- Each directory also contains a `README.md` as a guide.
